# osm-vector-mbtiles
OpenStreetMap vector tiles collection ready to go and help you host your own map server.

Reasoning behind repository is to point to easy to get mbTiles files, which I have not found
elsewhere on internet without limitations/sign-ups. 
OpenStreeMap is luckily open so hopefully having easy to get planet snapshot might help some projects.

Bigger files for whole planet are hosted in Internet Archive at https://archive.org/details/osm-vector-mbtiles
- planet file up to zoom level 14 for years 2019 and 2020
- regions up to level 14 when finished

This repository might carry more scripts and descriptions to help set up own map server using other excellent available tools out there.
